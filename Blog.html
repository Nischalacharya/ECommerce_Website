<p>
    The advantageous feature for communication is that technology affects through facilitation,
     speed and efficiency. You can track talks and so offer a better service to your customers.
      Tech also facilitates the collection of customer insights and 
    the whole customer experience.

<p>
    The almost unlimited access to knowledge is one of the first thoughts when talking about
     how technologyaffects education. A wealth of ebooks and audio books have been replaced by books.
     Knowledge is available online in a variety of formats, such as podcasts, videos and blogs, 
     which provide many open doors for much more efficient learning. Students also have deeper 
    access to another major study resource: their own peers. A major positive impact on education
     is that it bring together students through instruments of discussion and cooperation,
      who have never considered communicating or having a chance to support one another offline,
       enhancing collaboration and the diversification of content in their instruction.
